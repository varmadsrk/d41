#!/bin/bash

# We can print using two commands , 1. echo, 2. printf
# My choice of printing is echo command because you save lot of time with syntaxes

echo Hello 

 ## print multi line o/p

 echo Hello
 echo How are you?

 ### More number of commands will make equallent number of process in the system.
 ## so that is the reason we will try to minimize the number of commands as much as possible. 

 ## Printing I want to do in single command

 echo Hello How are You?
